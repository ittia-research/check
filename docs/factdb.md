Media including social-media should follow some basic standards.

Words are not just words, they expand and expand differently for different people in different time. They are like seeds, web grows out of them and expanding. One goal of counter disinformation is to stop the wrong one from expand.

We have some common expansion directions, for example:
  - When connected a object with a bad thing: blame

## Goals
- Index the web in the age of automation
  - [ ] What's the new data(database) standards in the age of AI?
  - [ ] How llm store facts? 
    - [ ] Maybe we can learn how to build a better database by separate the fact part from LLM model?
    - [ ] With a separate and accurate way to store facts, maybe the better way to provide facts to LLM is to connect the database with LLM natively.
    - researches:

- [ ] With the rapid development of information environment, humans along are destined to lose. The solution is machine VS machine.

## To-do
### Get Start
- [ ] Collect examples of mis/dis-information. (Anything related to facts can be used as example, focus on mis/dis-information at the moment.)
  - [ ] How to connect parts of one event in database?
  - [ ] How to connect entity to their roots, and choose what as roots?
  - [ ] From low level factual events to high level summary events.
- [ ] Split the examples to events: time range, known entity, happens(split so that can be matched exactly to a source)
- [ ] When statements is about a general conclusion, when and how to update its related facts to latest?

### Ensure
- [ ] Sematic search as well as accurate search

## Database components
- actual event

## Case Study
### Missing Context
The facts are correct but missing context and will led people misinterpret.

A photo of people wear T-shirt says "Warts for Trump". These people might named Walz but they have never spoken to The Tim Walz.
